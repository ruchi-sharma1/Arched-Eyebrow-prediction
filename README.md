# Arched-Eyebrow-prediction
# -> Dataset
Used CelebA dataset from kaggle.
# -> Objective
To create a ML model for any one feature, i choose to work on Arched shape of eyebrow of face.
# Important steps performed in this project
-> Performed various EDA method like to remove null and negative values. </br>
-> Found correlation among all the featues.</br>
-> Drawn plot using seaborn for arched eyebrow feature. </br>
-> Used NasNet pretrained model befor applying keras sequential layers. </br>
-> Adam optimizer was used.</br>
